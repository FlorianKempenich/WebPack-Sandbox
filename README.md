# Webpack Sandbox

Created thanks to this amazing website: https://createapp.dev/webpack

## Current State
This sandbox uses Webpack to do the following:
- Bundle JS files
- Offer support for SASS (SCSS)
- Runs autoprefixer on the resulting CSS
- Extract the CSS to a separate file (instead of embedding in the HTML)

## How to use?

Check the commits to see how each part of the solution was configured.
